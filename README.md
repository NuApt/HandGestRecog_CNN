# HandGestRecog_CNN
A Model that will perform Recognize Hand Gestures in real time using CNN, Having RealLife and Unique Dataset of Images. A good use of ML at beginner level. This model can be easily synced with the supporting Technologies such as Arduino boards and Raspberry Pi to Automate various things at home or work making life easier.
This is Application of Computer Vision Models using popular Machine Learning(ML) methods. In this Beginner level Project we have used Sequential API of CNN. This Code will really work faster on GPU's as compared to CPU's.
